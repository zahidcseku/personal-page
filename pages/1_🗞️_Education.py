- Spearheaded research projects that integrate advanced machine learning techniques into practical applications.
- Developed an innovative spatiotemporal prediction model combining recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural 
networks (GNNs).
- Developed explainability methods to draw insights from complex neural architectures.
- Three research papers are in preparation for top-tier conferences/journals.
- Interruptions: parental leave from 10/05/2022 to 06/06/2022.
- Main research projects:
    - Advanced deep neural network modelling involving graph neural network, recurrent neural network and 
    zero-inflated Poisson distribution for pest abundance estimation from sparse spatiotemporal observations.
    - Development of machine learning based estimation model for conservation actions.
    - Addressing bias and fairness in machine learning in collaboration with social scientists.

Passionate about the intersection of machine learning and real-world impact,
I'm a seasoned researcher with expertise in machine learning, text analysis, and
explainability methods. With a PhD in Computer and Information Science, I've
pioneered innovative approaches to enhance the accuracy and validity of machine
learning models.

Throughout my journey as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at CSIRO Australia,
I've collaborated with diverse business units to develop cutting-edge,
explainable machine learning models. My proficiency extends to Deep Neural
Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and
Sentiment Analysis.

My programming prowess in C, C++, Java, and Python enables me to bridge
theoretical innovation with practical implementation. Additionally, my commitment
to transparency and robustness has led me to specialize in explainability
methods, ensuring the reliability of models in critical applications.

From academia to industry, I've contributed as an educator, guiding students in
grasping complex concepts, and as a researcher, addressing research gaps with
innovative mathematical techniques. My track record as an Assistant Professor,
Online Tutor, and Research Assistant has equipped me with strong communication
and pedagogical skills, enabling me to translate intricate technical ideas
into accessible insights.
